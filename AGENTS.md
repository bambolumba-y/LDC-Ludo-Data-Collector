# ExecPlans

This repository uses ExecPlans to implement larger changes end-to-end.

If you are a coding agent:
1) Read `PLANS.md` (rules).
2) Read and follow `EXECPLAN.md` (the active plan).
3) Work milestone-by-milestone until Acceptance is satisfied.
4) Keep `EXECPLAN.md` up to date while you work (Progress, Decision Log, Surprises, Outcomes).

## Current active ExecPlan
- `EXECPLAN.md`
